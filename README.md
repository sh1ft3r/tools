- SEST.PY
   Sh1ft3r's External Security Test

   This is a simple tool written to execute tools I use white conducting pentests.
   The tool will make logs and directories according the tools used. 
   Using this tool makes me have more time to concentrate on other tests I need to do while pentesting.


- csrgen.sh
   This is a simple CSR generating script I use for generating for internal use or customers.

- nsloopup.sh
   This script will look for A records from a list of domains to ensure they point to somewhere.
   And if there is a A record, it will also lookup the NS record for this domain.

- passgen.py
   easy password generator on the fly. This was one of my first tools written for my ease of life use.
